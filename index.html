            <li><strong><em>Education.</em></strong></li>
            I attended primary school at Light Academy before transferring to Laiser Hill Academy where i completed my KCPE scoring 379 marks.
            I then proceeded to Laiser Hill Secondary School where i completed my secondary education scoring a C- in my KCSE examinations.
            I then joined Moringa School where i sought to learn coding and software development.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Software development.</em></strong></li>
        <div class="box">I am currently studying software development at Moringa School and at the end of it i aspire to be a fully equipped Software Developer.
            The reasons why i decided to take a course on programming are;
            I wanted to test myself on my ability to be able to come up with problems and solve them and i believe software programming gives a person that opportunity because you get to think out of the norm.
            Technology is also advancing and it changes every now and then and programming gives a person the opportunity to keep up with those changes.
            I desired to challenge myself to learn something that was said to be 'difficult'.
            My desire to acquire and learn a new skill caused me to choose to learn programming.</div>
